## What's Inside

The project includes custom implementations of several mathematical functions, such as:

- Trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`)
- Gamma and log-Gamma functions (`gamma`, `lgamma`)
- NaN checks and basic numeric utilities

> For a full list of available functions, see the source code.

## Standards & Compatibility

- Language: C (C99/C11)
- Numeric type: `st_real` (user-defined, typically `float` or `double`)
- Compiler tested: **GCC 15.1.1**

## Trash project ass always :)
